Version 0.1.

Summary of important externally visible changes since version 0.0:

Many miscellaneous bugs have been fixed.

Missing source files in 0.0 have been correctly added to the
distribution. 

Configuration now knows that various 386 equivalents use the same
assembly files.

There is now an nfsd; it has not be well-tested.  It would be nice if
some people would run it and try things out.  It does not yet support
Hurd-specific features.

Exec now compiles correctly even when you don't have BFD installed.

Ext2fs format interpretation problems have been fixed.  This means it
can be suitably used to boot with.

init now properly understands SIGHUP and SIGTERM, and does the right
thing correctly.

Much code has been written in nfs towards supporting version 3 of the
protocol, but it's not done yet.  Don't try and turn it on.

Version information in uname is now calculated differently.

Some improvements have been made in the SETUP script.

sync, reboot and halt now do argument parsing and understand --help and
--version. 

The new `e2os' program has been added to change the "creator OS" field
on an ext2fs filesystem.

Bugs in term and libtrivfs have been fixed, allowing emacs shell mode
to work cleanly.  Other minor bugs have also been fixed.

ufs and ext2fs now do directory search rotoring to speed repeated and
sequential directory lookups.  

ufs now notes correctly if a disk cannot be written to and turns on
the readonly flag automatically in this case.  (Useful for floppies.) 

ufs statfs information (printed by df) should now be correct.

A serious bug in ufs fsck when dealing with large directories has been
fixed.

A new program `vminfo' prints the virtual memory map of task.

All disk filesystems (ufs and ext2fs) now do directory name caching of
`..' which was not previously done.  In addition, you can now set the
cache size to be large, and then do experiments and see what the cache
hit rate would have been for various smaller sizes.  This should help
in optimizing the size of the cache.

A port leak in the pager library has been fixed; previously ufs leaked
two ports per file used until the kernel's limit (about 30,000) was
reached.
