GNU Hurd version 0.0.


This is the Hurd.  Welcome.

For instructions on compiling and installing the GNU Hurd from an
already running Hurd system, see the file `INSTALL'.

It is possible to cross-build the Hurd; the file INSTALL-cross
contains some past instructions for doing so, but it's too much
trouble to maintain them and make them easier.  Your best bet is to
start with a running Hurd system already.

Please note that this directory also contains a fair amount of
not-yet-working code.  The makefiles build only the working code by
default. 

The GNU Hurd is free software.  All of it, including the libraries in
this distribution, is covered by the GNU General Public License, found
in the file COPYING.
