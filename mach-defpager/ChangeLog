	* main.c (main): Instead of calling daemon, do the work ourselves but
	synchronize with the child so that vm_set_default_memory_manager has
	definitely been called before exit.
	(nohandler): New function.

	Override the shared code from serverboot for device access with
	a new, simpler implementation with no filesystem format support.
	The new code implements the new default_pager_paging_storage RPC
	to set up paging areas that can be subsets of whole Mach devices,
	with no Linux signature checking.  The compatibility setup entry
	point works as before on whole devices.
	* setup.c, file_io.h: New files.
	* Makefile (SRCS): Remove def_pager_setup.c, file_io.c, strfcns.c,
	ext2_file_io.c, ffs_file_io.c, ffs_compat.c, minix_file_io.c,
	minix_ffs_compat.c; add setup.c to replace them all.

	* Makefile: Move include ../Makeconf earlier, since it sets srcdir.

1999-11-18  Roland McGrath  <roland@baalperazim.frob.com>

	* Makefile, main.c: New files for new this directory `mach-defpager'.
	This is a standalone Hurd program version of the Mach default pager,
	with the bulk of the source code coming from ../serverboot.
	This program /hurd/mach-defpager is started like a normal daemon,
	i.e. from rc or whatever, rather than being the first task.
	* ChangeLog: New file, mentioning itself in this sentence.
