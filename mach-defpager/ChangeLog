	* Makefile, main.c: New files for new this directory `mach-defpager'.
	This is a standalone Hurd program version of the Mach default pager,
	with the bulk of the source code coming from ../serverboot.
	This program /hurd/mach-defpager is started like a normal daemon,
	i.e. from rc or whatever, rather than being the first task.
	* ChangeLog: New file, mentioning itself in this sentence.
