I am pleased to announce version 0.0 of the GNU Hurd, available via
anonymous FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu [18.159.0.42] in the file
/pub/gnu/hurd-0.0.tar.gz (about XXX MB compressed).

This file contains complete source code for the following:

Hurd servers: auth, crash, devio, devport, exec, ext2fs, fifo, fwd,
ifsock, init, magic, new-fifo, nfs, null, pfinet, pflocal, proc,
symlink, term, ufs.

Hurd libraries: diskfs, fshelp, ihash, iohelp, netfs, pager, pipe,
ports, ps, shouldbeinlibc, store, threads, trivfs.

Hurd utilities, etc: boot, shd, ps, settrans, showtrans, sync, su,
mount, fsysopts, storeinfo, login, w, uptime, hurdids, loginpr, sush,
vmstat, portinfo, devprobe, reboot, halt, fsck, fsck.ufs, mkfs.ufs,
clri.ufs, stati.ufs, getty, rc.



In addition, we have prepared a binary distribution of a complete
version 0.0 GNU system corresponding to this Hurd release.  This
release runs only on PC-AT compatible systems with i[345]86
processors.

The GNU Hurd, plus MACH, is a kernel, not an operating system.  The
GNU operating system, like the Unix operating system, consists of many
components, including kernel, libraries, compilers, assembler, shell,
parser generators, utilities, window system, editors, text formatters,
and so on.  The GNU project set out a decade ago to develop this
system, and we've been writing various components of it ever since.

This release uses the `UK22' version of the Mach kernel, as
distributed by the University of Utah.  It is too difficult to prepare
a detailed list of supported devices at this point.  Common disk
controllers and ethernet cards are surely supported.

This release does not contain the X Window System.

This release may be found by anonymous FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu
[18.159.42] in the directory /pub/gnu/gnu-0.0/.

In that directory, you should find the following files:

grub-boot.image
SOURCES
INSTALL-binary
gnu-0.0.tar.gz

SOURCES contains a complete list describing the sources for the
binaries found in the image.  INSTALL-binary contains complete
installation instructions for this release.  gnu-0.0.tar.gz hold the
image of complete system.

grub-boot.image is an image of a floppy disk that you will need to
complete part of the installation instructions.

The following free software packages are found in this release:

autoconf, automake, bash, bc, binutils, bison, cpio, cvs, diffutils,
doschk, e2fsprogs, ed, emacs, fileutils, findutils, flex, from, gawk,
