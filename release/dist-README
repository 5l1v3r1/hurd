Welcome to the GNU Hurd!


For instructions on compiling and installing the GNU Hurd from an
already running Hurd system, see the file `INSTALL'.

For instructions on compiling and installing the GNU Hurd from any
other kind of system (including any other Mach-based system) see the
file INSTALL-cross.

For instructions on installing binary images and setting up a Hurd
system, see the file INSTALL-binary.  (These binary images could be
the ones we distribute, or the ones you have built yourself as
described in INSTALL-cross.)
